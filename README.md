# Lego Legacy: Phrases Unleashed

On 2021-03-03 Gameloft released an update to "Lego Legacy: Heroes Unboxed"
(a - imho - P2W, Turn-based strategy Mobile Game) which gave Players the
possibility to "chat" with each other in their respected Guild.

Unfortunately the chat only consists of prephrased messages which are , at the
moment & for the most part, not helpful to really communicate ingame. The
community on Discord made fun of this (wait a sec ... is that the reason why
the Lego Group does not wan't to have an uncontrolled messaging service running
under the LEGO Brand? Are they afraid of salty male adults chatting with
innocent children ... oh crap ... now I understand). So I made this little tool
to fake said messages and let them look as close as possible to the original
without the need of Photoshop or any other tool or particular skills.

## Features
- Create fake phrases (basically "real" chat messages)
- Fake Achievements
- Save current input in LocalStorage to restore everything after reload
- Render an image that'll be directly downloaded
- Some Eastereggs üê∞
